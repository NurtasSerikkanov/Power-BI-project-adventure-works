Adventure Works Sales Dashboard

Overview
In this project, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard using the AdventureWorks dataset. It focuses on analyzing sales, customer trends, product performance, and regional insights. Below, Iâ€™ll explain each screenshot and what insights it provides.

1. Product Performance
Using a Donut Chart and a Line Chart, I analyzed the revenue generated by different product categories. The donut chart shows the proportion of revenue by product categories (e.g., Bikes, Accessories), while the line chart tracks the revenue trends over time. A table lists the top-selling products along with their return rates.

This page is useful for understanding which products drive the most revenue and how they perform over time.

2. Customer Insights
Here, I used a Pie Chart to display the breakdown of customers by region. KPIs such as "Total Customers" and "Average Revenue Per Customer" summarize customer performance. I also included a Line Chart that tracks revenue and customer growth trends over the years.

This page helps visualize how different regions contribute to customer growth and revenue.

3. Regional Sales Overview
Using a combination of a Map and a Bar Chart, I displayed sales and return rates by region. The map highlights which regions generate the highest revenue, while the bar chart focuses on return rates by location. KPIs like "Total Revenue" and "Total Orders" make it easy to compare regional performance.

This section is ideal for identifying high-performing regions and areas with high return rates.

4. Sales Trends
A Clustered Bar Chart and a Line Chart were used to show monthly sales trends. The bar chart compares sales performance across months, while the line chart provides a clear view of year-over-year growth.

This page focuses on sales trends over time and helps identify patterns in monthly and yearly sales.

5. Weekend vs Weekday Sales
For this page, I used a Bar Chart and a Line Chart to compare sales performance on weekends versus weekdays. The bar chart highlights the total orders placed on workdays versus weekends, and the line chart tracks revenue trends for both over time.

This page is helpful for understanding customer behavior during different parts of the week.

6. Order Trends Analysis
This page includes a Pie Chart for orders by region and a Table showing monthly order growth rates. Additionally, a Line Chart tracks orders over time. KPIs like "Average Orders Per Day" provide quick summaries of overall order performance.

This page is designed to highlight order patterns and identify areas of growth.

Tools and Techniques
Power BI: Designed and built dashboards using visualizations like line charts, donut charts, maps, and bar charts.
DAX: Created calculated measures such as Total Revenue, Customer Lifetime Value, and Return Rates.
Time Intelligence: Used DAX functions like DATESYTD and DATESINPERIOD for rolling averages and cumulative totals.

Key Insights
Certain regions like Australia and Southeast generate the most revenue, while others have higher return rates.
Customer lifetime value is significantly influenced by frequent buyers, which are easily tracked using filters and slicers.
Product categories like Bikes dominate revenue, with Accessories contributing less but showing steady growth.

How to Use
Interactive Slicers: Filter data by regions, categories, and dates to explore different trends.
Hover for Details: Hover over visuals for detailed information about each metric.
Cross-Filtering: Click on a region, category, or product in any visualization to see the corresponding changes across the dashboard.
