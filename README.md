Adventure Works Sales Dashboard

About the Project
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard I created to analyze sales data, customer trends, product performance, and regional sales distribution. Using the AdventureWorks dataset, I designed multiple pages to provide a comprehensive view of the business performance over time. Each page focuses on a different aspect of the business, helping decision-makers explore insights and trends interactively.

Includes KPIs for total revenue, total orders, and returns.
Helps identify regions with the highest and lowest sales performance.


2. Customer Insights
Provides an overview of customer behavior and contribution to revenue.
Includes a pie chart breaking down customers by region and KPIs for customer growth rate and lifetime value.
Interactive slicers allow filtering by date ranges to analyze trends over time.

3. Product Performance
Analyzes revenue by product category and subcategory with visualizations like donut charts and line graphs.
